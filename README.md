# ansible-installApache

This will automatically install Apache, PHP, MYSql and start up Ubuntu local host using Ansible. 
I've also added how to copy and pasta your local files using my sample html/css to your instance, customized ssh login, add group, and add users with and without sudo privilege. 

See https://www.ansible.com/ for more documentations.
