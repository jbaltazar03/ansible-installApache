# ansible-installApache

This will install Apache, PHP, and MYSql to start up Ubuntu server apache automatically using Ansible. 
I've also added how to copy and pasta your local files using my sample html/css to your instance, customized your ssh login, add group, and add users with and without sudo privilege. 

See https://www.ansible.com/ for more documentations.
